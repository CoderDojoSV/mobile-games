# Section 0: Installation and Introduction to Corona SDK and Lua

This section will focus on the installation and setup of [Corona SDK](http://coronalabs.com/).
Students will:

* Setup a Corona SDK account
* Install the Corona SDK software
* Run a sample Corona application on their mobile device or emulator
* Start on a set of Lua practice exercises

## Setting up Corona SDK

### What's Corona? What's an SDK? Why do we need one?

Building programs on modern computers is super challenging. Even cellphones are
richer in features and much more complex than the computers I learned to play
and make games on. Luckily, there are tools that try their best to make writing
games easier again. One of these toolsets is called the Corona SDK. SDK means
**S**oftware **D**evelopment **K**it. One of the neat things about Corona is
that it is *cross platform* meaning it can help you make games for multiple
types of devices. So if you have an Android device or an iOS device, you can
write your game once and have it run in both places.
