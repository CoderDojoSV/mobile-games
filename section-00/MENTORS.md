# Mentor Notes for Section 00

This first section is focused entirely on getting the necessary tools set up.
All developer tools are a pain to set up and not allocating an entire 90 minute
session to do so would be naive and disastrous.

This is going to be the hardest class to keep all the students at the same pace.
We'll be encouraging any students who are stuck in the process to ask for help
and those who are too shy to do so, make sure they don't flail and that they're
making progress.

For those who do finish early, we have a set of Lua exercises which you should
definitely do ahead of time so you're prepared to answer questions. Encourage
the students to move to the exercises once they've played through the Hello
game a few times.
