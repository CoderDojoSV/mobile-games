## About Corona SDK

Corona SDK is a commercial software product from Corona Labs. It's free to use
to make games for yourself but requires a paid yearly subscription to put
applications in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.

The complete documentation as well as many tutorials and guides for Corona SDK
is available at <http://docs.coronalabs.com>.

Help with Corona applications can come from StackOverflow questions tagged with
"corona": <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/corona> or from the
official Corona forums: <http://forums.coronalabs.com/>. Neither Corona's forums
nor StackOverflow are moderated by Coder Dojo so make sure you get permission
before creating accounts and participating in discussions yourself. In the
future we may have a Coder Dojo discussion forum that is moderated by us. Stay
in touch with <http://www.coderdojosv.com/> for the latest updates.

## About Lua
 
The [introduction to Lua][itl] from this course is a good start for using the
Lua programming language with Corona. 

The complete Lua reference manual is available from
<http://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/> but it can be a bit daunting at times. Earlier
editions of the book are free. The most recent free book is always available
online at <http://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html>.

You can also check the [Lua tag on StackOverflow][so-lua].

## About iOS Programming

When programming specifically for Apple devices, you can still use Corona SDK
and continue writing in Lua. However, you might want the power of using Apple's
native tools and the Objective C programming language.  Apple's developer
program is the only way to access documentation and tools required to build iOS
programs and applications. If you just want to dip your toes in the pool and try
Objective C, [Code School][] has a [Try Objective-C][] and [Try iOS][] courses
available. Try iOS costs money but the author of this document is a regular
student of Code School courses and recommends them highly.

If you can remember all the way back to the first session, we set up
provisioning profiles and certificates when building for iOS. To do this
yourself requires an Apple Developer account which costs $100 per year. You can
continue using the profile we created to build applications but it is limited to
devices you added to the provisioning profile during that night. If you have any
trouble or questions with the iOS build requirements contact [Coder Dojo SV
HQ][cdsv].

## About Android Programming

You can, of course, continue using the Corona SDK to create Android programs and
games. The Android development tools are freely available from Google and might
be interesting to you. You can get them from
<https://developer.android.com/index.html>. The [Android Developer's Guide][adg]
might also be interesting to you.
