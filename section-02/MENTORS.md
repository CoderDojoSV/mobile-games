# Mentor notes for section 02

***Reminder*** Lua lists are 1-indexed but our grid, which we create
manually is 0-indexed. There's a side quest at the end of the lesson
that hopefully elucidates this for kids.

I accidentally introduced a stumbling block last week, which is that I went
column by column creating the rfk grid to match how cartesian coordinates are
written in mathematics instead of row by row like *every game author* ever. I
knew something felt funny but I couldn't figure out what. Now it's obvious why
it felt weird so keep an eye out for x-y reversals in today's lab.
